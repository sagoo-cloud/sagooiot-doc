Today, we have restructured the SagooIoT documentation site using Docusaurus3, a React-based static site generator designed for building documentation sites for open-source projects.

For the SagooIoT documentation site, I aim to make it more concise, easier to maintain, and more readable. Docusaurus3 offers many features, and I will gradually implement these features to enhance the SagooIoT documentation site.
